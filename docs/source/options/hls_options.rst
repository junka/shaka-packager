HLS options
^^^^^^^^^^^

--hls_master_playlist_output <file_path>

    Output path for the master playlist for HLS. This flag must be used to
    output HLS.

--hls_base_url <url>

    The base URL for the Media Playlists and media files listed in the
    playlists. This is the prefix for the files.

--hls_key_uri <uri>

    The key uri for 'identity' and 'com.apple.streamingkeydelivery' (FairPlay)
    key formats. Ignored if the playlist is not encrypted or not using the above
    key formats.

--hls_playlist_type <type>

    VOD, EVENT, or LIVE. This defines the EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE in the HLS
    specification. For hls_playlist_type of LIVE, EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE tag is
    omitted.

--time_shift_buffer_depth <seconds>

    Guaranteed duration of the time shifting buffer for LIVE playlists, in
    seconds.

--preserved_segments_outside_live_window <num_segments>

    Segments outside the live window (defined by `time_shift_buffer_depth`
    above) are automatically removed except for the most recent X segments
    defined by this parameter. This is needed to accommodate latencies in
    various stages of content serving pipeline, so that the segments stay
    accessible as they may still be accessed by the player.

    The segments are not removed if the value is zero.

--default_language <language>

    The first audio/text rendition in a group tagged with this language will
    have 'DEFAULT' attribute set to 'YES'. This allows the player to choose the
    correct default language for the content.

    This applies to both audio and text tracks. The default language for text
    tracks can be overriden by  'default_text_language'.

--default_text_language <text_language>

    Same as above, but this applies to text tracks only, and overrides the
    default language for text tracks.
